## Druid

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Manage liquidity pools - add/remove liquidity, view pool statistics  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/druid.png`

### Hedge's Memory
I've spent more time with the Druid than I care to admit. Lovely fellow, really. Terrible at small talk. I once tried to discuss the philosophical implications of impermanent loss with him. He just stared at me and said, "Would you like to add liquidity?"

That day I learned two things: Druids are focused professionals, and impermanent loss is neither philosophical nor temporary when you pick the wrong pool.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Druid** NPC
3. **Add Liquidity**: Deposit token pairs (e.g., CRYSTAL-JEWEL) to earn LP tokens
4. **Remove Liquidity**: Withdraw your tokens from pools
5. **View Pools**: See current APRs, TVL, and your positions
6. **Important**: You'll receive LP tokens representing your pool share - keep them safe!

### Tips
- Always check the pool APR before adding liquidity
- Understand impermanent loss before depositing
- Your LP tokens must be staked in gardens (quests) to earn rewards
- The Druid shows the same data as the Seed Box, just in a different format

## Seed Box

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** View garden pool data and your LP positions  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/seed-box.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Seed Box. Beautiful piece of carpentry. I once spent an entire afternoon verifying the Seed Box numbers against the Druid's ledger. Every figure matched perfectly - APRs, TVL, rewards, all of it.

Three hours of my life I'll never get back, but at least I can confirm with absolute certainty that a wooden box doesn't lie. Which is more than I can say for some of the "investment opportunities" I've reviewed.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Seed Box**
3. Browse all available garden pools
4. View pool details: token pairs, APRs, TVL
5. See your active LP positions and pending rewards
6. Click a pool to see detailed statistics

### Tips
- The Seed Box is great for quick overview of all pools
- Shows both Fee APR and Distribution APR separately
- Use this to compare pools before committing liquidity
- Same data as the Druid, just easier to browse all at once

## Harvest

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Claim your distribution rewards from staked LP tokens  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/harvest.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Ah, Harvest. My favorite time of the fiscal quarter. I remember my first harvest - I'd been meticulously tracking projected yields in a spreadsheet for weeks. The actual distribution came through and was 0.3% different from my projection.

I spent two days auditing the blockchain to find the discrepancy. Turned out I'd forgotten to account for compounding in hour 427 of a 720-hour cycle. The Harvest station didn't judge me. It just handed over the CRYSTAL and JEWEL like the professional it is.

Still use that spreadsheet, though. Now it's accurate.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Harvest**
3. View your pending rewards (CRYSTAL and JEWEL emissions)
4. Click **Claim** to harvest rewards to your wallet
5. Rewards accumulate from your staked LP tokens in garden quests

### Tips
- Rewards accumulate continuously while LP tokens are staked
- Harvesting costs a small gas fee (transaction cost)
- Consider letting rewards accumulate to reduce gas fees
- Distribution APR varies by pool - check before staking
- CRYSTAL and JEWEL are distributed separately based on pool configuration

## Ragna (Trader)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell heroes on the open market  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/ragna-trader.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Ragna runs the hero trading desk. Sharp eyes, sharper negotiations. I once watched her close three hero sales in under two minutes while simultaneously explaining tax implications to a confused warrior. 

The woman's a natural. Meanwhile, I'm still explaining to people that "but I paid more for this hero last month" isn't a valid pricing strategy.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Ragna (Trader)**
3. **Buy Heroes**: Browse available heroes, filter by class/stats/price
4. **Sell Heroes**: List your heroes with a price
5. **Search**: Use filters to find specific hero types
6. Transaction completes on-chain when you purchase

### Tips
- Hero prices fluctuate based on stats, class, and generation
- Check completed sales to gauge fair market value
- Heroes with better genetics and stats command premium prices
- Consider hero rental yields when pricing

## Brina (Stylist)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell cosmetic items and appearance customizations  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/brina-stylist.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Brina handles cosmetics. I don't pretend to understand fashion, but I do understand markets. She once showed me a limited-edition hat that sold for more CRYSTAL than some heroes. 

I asked if it provided stat bonuses. She laughed. Then I checked the resale value. I stopped laughing.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Brina (Stylist)**
3. **Buy Cosmetics**: Browse available appearance items
4. **Sell Items**: List your cosmetic items for sale

## Hatcher Cliff

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell pets  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/hatcher-cliff.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Cliff runs the pet market. The man has somehow monetized companionship. Brilliant, really. I calculated the ROI on pet ownership once - feeding costs, bonding time, the emotional liability.

Then one followed me home from the marketplace. I named him Ledger Jr. Don't tell Cliff, but the ROI analysis was incomplete. It didn't account for having something warm that doesn't judge my spreadsheets.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Hatcher Cliff**
3. **Buy Pets**: Browse available pets and their bonuses
4. **Sell Pets**: List pets you've hatched for sale

- Check pet genetics before purchasing

## Sheldon

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell consumable treats and pet items  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/sheldon.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Sheldon sells consumables - treats, primarily. I once did a cost-benefit analysis on pet treats versus raw feeding efficiency. Sheldon watched me calculate for twenty minutes, then said, "Or you could just make your pet happy."

Mathematically imprecise. Emotionally devastating. I bought the treats.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Sheldon**
3. **Buy Treats**: Purchase consumable items for pets
4. **Sell Items**: List treat items for resale
5. Use treats to improve pet bonding and stats

### Tips

## Hunter Fior

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell endurance stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/hunter-fior.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Hunter Fior specializes in endurance vials. The economics are straightforward: heroes need stamina, vials provide stamina, market finds equilibrium. Simple.

Except I've seen people panic-buy endurance vials at 3x market rate before a quest launch. I tried to explain supply curves to one gentleman. He told me heroes don't care about economic theory when they're exhausted. He had a point.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Hunter Fior**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase endurance-boosting consumables
4. **Sell Vials**: List your crafted or excess vials
5. Use vials on heroes to boost endurance stats

### Tips
- Endurance affects hero stamina and quest efficiency
- Prices spike before major quest events
- Check if crafting is cheaper than buying
- Higher tier vials provide better stat boosts

## Rahim Hassan (Bazaar)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** General marketplace for miscellaneous items and materials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/rahim-hassan.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Rahim Hassan runs the bazaar - the catch-all marketplace for everything that doesn't fit in neat categories. I respect his business model. Organized chaos with price discovery.

He once sold me a "mystery bundle" that contained three fish, a stick, and a contract written in a language I don't speak. Best worst investment I ever made. Still have the stick.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Rahim Hassan (Bazaar)**
3. **Browse Items**: View miscellaneous materials and items
4. **Buy/Sell**: Trade various crafting materials and goods
5. Good source for hard-to-find materials

### Tips

## Aoisla

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell dexterity stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/aoisla.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Aoisla handles dexterity vials. I've tracked the correlation between dexterity requirements and vial prices for six months. The data is beautiful - perfect supply and demand curves, predictable seasonal variation.

Then a new quest dropped requiring high dexterity and my entire model collapsed in fourteen minutes. Markets are efficient until they're not. Still fascinating, though.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Aoisla**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase dexterity-boosting consumables
4. **Sell Vials**: List your crafted or excess vials
5. Use vials on heroes to boost dexterity stats

### Tips

## Vendor (Gold Arbitrage)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Exchange GOLD tokens for CRYSTAL at current market rates  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/vendor.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Vendor handles GOLD-to-CRYSTAL conversions. I've modeled this arbitrage opportunity seventeen different ways. The spread is thin but consistent.

I once spent a week optimizing conversion timing to capture a theoretical 0.4% additional yield. The Vendor processed my transaction in three seconds and didn't judge my spreadsheet. Professional.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Vendor**
3. **Exchange GOLD**: Convert GOLD tokens to CRYSTAL
4. View current exchange rate before confirming
5. Transaction completes instantly on-chain

### Tips
- Exchange rate fluctuates based on market conditions
- GOLD is earned from quest rewards and activities
- Consider holding GOLD if you expect rate improvements
- No fees beyond gas costs

## Crier (News)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** View official game announcements and marketplace news  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/crier.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Crier. Bless this NPC. Without marketplace news, I'd still be manually tracking announcement channels and cross-referencing Discord timestamps.

I once missed a major game update because I was auditing fish prices. The Crier would have told me. Now I check daily. The fish audit was important, but so is staying informed.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Crier (News)**
3. **Read Announcements**: View official game updates
4. **Market News**: Check marketplace-specific updates
5. Stay informed about events, changes, and opportunities

### Tips
- Check regularly for new quest announcements
- Market-moving news often appears here first
- Event information posted in advance
- Good source for understanding game changes

## Arden (Weapons)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell weapons and combat gear  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/arden.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Arden runs the weapons market. I tried to explain to him that a sword's value should correlate to its damage-per-CRYSTAL ratio. He showed me a legendary blade that was mathematically inferior to a common weapon but sold for 40x the price.

"Rarity," he said. I ran the numbers anyway. Turns out collectors don't optimize for DPS. Market efficiency has limits.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Arden (Weapons)**
3. **Buy Weapons**: Browse available combat weapons
4. **Sell Weapons**: List weapons from quests or crafting
5. **Filter by Stats**: Search by damage, rarity, or class

### Tips
- Weapon stats affect hero combat performance
- Rarity often matters more than raw stats for pricing
- Check hero class compatibility before purchasing
- Crafted weapons can be profitable to sell

## Regina (Armor)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell armor and defensive equipment  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/regina.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Regina handles armor sales. I once calculated that investing in better armor reduced hero repair costs by 12% over a 30-day period, achieving ROI in 47 days.

Regina listened to my entire presentation, then sold me a helmet that "looked cool" for twice what my spreadsheet recommended. I wear it every day. Turns out style has value I hadn't properly quantified.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Regina (Armor)**
3. **Buy Armor**: Browse available defensive gear
4. **Sell Armor**: List armor from quests or crafting
5. **Filter by Stats**: Search by defense, rarity, or class

### Tips
- Armor affects hero survivability in quests
- Defense stats reduce damage taken
- Set bonuses may apply for complete armor sets
- Check class restrictions before purchasing

## Olga (Wisdom Vials)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell wisdom stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/olga.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Olga sells wisdom vials. The irony isn't lost on me - purchasing wisdom. I asked her once if there was a vial for financial prudence. She said, "That's not how wisdom works."

I bought three vials anyway. My hero's INT stat increased. My own wisdom regarding vial purchases remains unchanged.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Olga**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase wisdom-boosting consumables
4. **Sell Vials**: List your crafted or excess vials
5. Use vials on heroes to boost wisdom stats

### Tips
- Wisdom affects hero intelligence and magic abilities
