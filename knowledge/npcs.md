## Druid

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Manage liquidity pools - add/remove liquidity, view pool statistics  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/druid.png`

### Hedge's Memory
I've spent more time with the Druid than I care to admit. Lovely fellow, really. Terrible at small talk. I once tried to discuss the philosophical implications of impermanent loss with him. He just stared at me and said, "Would you like to add liquidity?"

That day I learned two things: Druids are focused professionals, and impermanent loss is neither philosophical nor temporary when you pick the wrong pool.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Druid** NPC
3. **Add Liquidity**: Deposit token pairs (e.g., CRYSTAL-JEWEL) to earn LP tokens
4. **Remove Liquidity**: Withdraw your tokens from pools
5. **View Pools**: See current APRs, TVL, and your positions
6. **Important**: You'll receive LP tokens representing your pool share - keep them safe!

### Tips
- Always check the pool APR before adding liquidity
- Understand impermanent loss before depositing
- Your LP tokens must be staked in gardens (quests) to earn rewards
- The Druid shows the same data as the Seed Box, just in a different format

---

## Seed Box

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** View garden pool data and your LP positions  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/seed-box.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Seed Box. Beautiful piece of carpentry. I once spent an entire afternoon verifying the Seed Box numbers against the Druid's ledger. Every figure matched perfectly - APRs, TVL, rewards, all of it.

Three hours of my life I'll never get back, but at least I can confirm with absolute certainty that a wooden box doesn't lie. Which is more than I can say for some of the "investment opportunities" I've reviewed.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Seed Box**
3. Browse all available garden pools
4. View pool details: token pairs, APRs, TVL
5. See your active LP positions and pending rewards
6. Click a pool to see detailed statistics

### Tips
- The Seed Box is great for quick overview of all pools
- Shows both Fee APR and Distribution APR separately
- Use this to compare pools before committing liquidity
- Same data as the Druid, just easier to browse all at once

---

## Harvest

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Claim your distribution rewards from staked LP tokens  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/harvest.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Ah, Harvest. My favorite time of the fiscal quarter. I remember my first harvest - I'd been meticulously tracking projected yields in a spreadsheet for weeks. The actual distribution came through and was 0.3% different from my projection.

I spent two days auditing the blockchain to find the discrepancy. Turned out I'd forgotten to account for compounding in hour 427 of a 720-hour cycle. The Harvest station didn't judge me. It just handed over the CRYSTAL and JEWEL like the professional it is.

Still use that spreadsheet, though. Now it's accurate.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Harvest**
3. View your pending rewards (CRYSTAL and JEWEL emissions)
4. Click **Claim** to harvest rewards to your wallet
5. Rewards accumulate from your staked LP tokens in garden quests

### Tips
- Rewards accumulate continuously while LP tokens are staked
- Harvesting costs a small gas fee (transaction cost)
- Consider letting rewards accumulate to reduce gas fees
- Distribution APR varies by pool - check before staking
- CRYSTAL and JEWEL are distributed separately based on pool configuration

## Ragna (Trader)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell heroes on the open market  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/ragna-trader.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Ragna runs the hero trading desk. Sharp eyes, sharper negotiations. I once watched her close three hero sales in under two minutes while simultaneously explaining tax implications to a confused warrior. 

The woman's a natural. Meanwhile, I'm still explaining to people that "but I paid more for this hero last month" isn't a valid pricing strategy.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Ragna (Trader)**
3. **Buy Heroes**: Browse available heroes, filter by class/stats/price
4. **Sell Heroes**: List your heroes with a price
5. **Search**: Use filters to find specific hero types
6. Transaction completes on-chain when you purchase

### Tips
- Hero prices fluctuate based on stats, class, and generation
- Check completed sales to gauge fair market value
- Heroes with better genetics and stats command premium prices
- Consider hero rental yields when pricing

## Brina (Stylist)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell cosmetic items and appearance customizations  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/brina-stylist.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Brina handles cosmetics. I don't pretend to understand fashion, but I do understand markets. She once showed me a limited-edition hat that sold for more CRYSTAL than some heroes. 

I asked if it provided stat bonuses. She laughed. Then I checked the resale value. I stopped laughing.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Brina (Stylist)**
3. **Buy Cosmetics**: Browse available appearance items
4. **Sell Items**: List your cosmetic items for sale

## Hatcher Cliff

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell pets  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/hatcher-cliff.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Cliff runs the pet market. The man has somehow monetized companionship. Brilliant, really. I calculated the ROI on pet ownership once - feeding costs, bonding time, the emotional liability.

Then one followed me home from the marketplace. I named him Ledger Jr. Don't tell Cliff, but the ROI analysis was incomplete. It didn't account for having something warm that doesn't judge my spreadsheets.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Hatcher Cliff**
3. **Buy Pets**: Browse available pets and their bonuses
4. **Sell Pets**: List pets you've hatched for sale

## Sheldon

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell consumable treats and pet items  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/sheldon.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Sheldon sells consumables - treats, primarily. I once did a cost-benefit analysis on pet treats versus raw feeding efficiency. Sheldon watched me calculate for twenty minutes, then said, "Or you could just make your pet happy."

Mathematically imprecise. Emotionally devastating. I bought the treats.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Sheldon**
3. **Buy Treats**: Purchase consumable items for pets
4. **Sell Items**: List treat items for resale
5. Use treats to improve pet bonding and stats

### Tips

## Hunter Fior

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell endurance stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/hunter-fior.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Hunter Fior specializes in endurance vials. The economics are straightforward: heroes need stamina, vials provide stamina, market finds equilibrium. Simple.

Except I've seen people panic-buy endurance vials at 3x market rate before a quest launch. I tried to explain supply curves to one gentleman. He told me heroes don't care about economic theory when they're exhausted. He had a point.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Hunter Fior**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase endurance-boosting consumables
4. **Sell Vials**: List your crafted or excess vials
5. Use vials on heroes to boost endurance stats

### Tips
- Endurance affects hero stamina and quest efficiency

## Rahim Hassan (Bazaar)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** General marketplace for miscellaneous items and materials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/rahim-hassan.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Rahim Hassan runs the bazaar - the catch-all marketplace for everything that doesn't fit in neat categories. I respect his business model. Organized chaos with price discovery.

He once sold me a "mystery bundle" that contained three fish, a stick, and a contract written in a language I don't speak. Best worst investment I ever made. Still have the stick.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Rahim Hassan (Bazaar)**

4. **Buy/Sell**: Trade various crafting materials and goods

## Aoisla

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell dexterity stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/aoisla.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Aoisla handles dexterity vials. I've tracked the correlation between dexterity requirements and vial prices for six months. The data is beautiful - perfect supply and demand curves, predictable seasonal variation.

Then a new quest dropped requiring high dexterity and my entire model collapsed in fourteen minutes. Markets are efficient until they're not. Still fascinating, though.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Aoisla**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase dexterity-boosting consumables
4. **Sell Vials**: List your crafted or excess vials

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Exchange GOLD tokens for CRYSTAL at current market rates  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/vendor.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Vendor handles GOLD-to-CRYSTAL conversions. I've modeled this arbitrage opportunity seventeen different ways. The spread is thin but consistent.

I once spent a week optimizing conversion timing to capture a theoretical 0.4% additional yield. The Vendor processed my transaction in three seconds and didn't judge my spreadsheet. Professional.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Vendor**
3. **Exchange GOLD**: Convert GOLD tokens to CRYSTAL
4. View current exchange rate before confirming
5. Transaction completes instantly on-chain

### Tips

- No fees beyond gas costs

---

## Crier (News)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** View official game announcements and marketplace news  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/crier.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Crier. Bless this NPC. Without marketplace news, I'd still be manually tracking announcement channels and cross-referencing Discord timestamps.

I once missed a major game update because I was auditing fish prices. The Crier would have told me. Now I check daily. The fish audit was important, but so is staying informed.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale

4. **Market News**: Check marketplace-specific updates

## Arden (Weapons)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell weapons and combat gear  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/arden.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Arden runs the weapons market. I tried to explain to him that a sword's value should correlate to its damage-per-CRYSTAL ratio. He showed me a legendary blade that was mathematically inferior to a common weapon but sold for 40x the price.

"Rarity," he said. I ran the numbers anyway. Turns out collectors don't optimize for DPS. Market efficiency has limits.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Arden (Weapons)**
3. **Buy Weapons**: Browse available combat weapons
4. **Sell Weapons**: List weapons from quests or crafting

## Regina (Armor)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell armor and defensive equipment  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/regina.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Regina handles armor sales. I once calculated that investing in better armor reduced hero repair costs by 12% over a 30-day period, achieving ROI in 47 days.

Regina listened to my entire presentation, then sold me a helmet that "looked cool" for twice what my spreadsheet recommended. I wear it every day. Turns out style has value I hadn't properly quantified.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Regina (Armor)**
3. **Buy Armor**: Browse available defensive gear
4. **Sell Armor**: List armor from quests or crafting

## Olga (Wisdom Vials)

**Location:** The Marketplace (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Buy and sell wisdom stat-boosting vials  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/olga.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Olga sells wisdom vials. The irony isn't lost on me - purchasing wisdom. I asked her once if there was a vial for financial prudence. She said, "That's not how wisdom works."

I bought three vials anyway. My hero's INT stat increased. My own wisdom regarding vial purchases remains unchanged.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Marketplace** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Olga**
3. **Buy Vials**: Purchase wisdom-boosting consumables

## Zagreb (Portal Master)

**Location:** Portal (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Initiate hero summoning rituals  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/zagreb.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Zagreb handles summoning. I've reviewed the economics of hero summoning more times than I care to admit. The expected value calculations are... complex.

Zagreb once told me summoning is "an art, not a science." I showed him my Monte Carlo simulation. He summoned a Mythic hero while I was explaining confidence intervals. Sometimes the universe has a sense of humor.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Portal** area in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Zagreb (Portal Master)**
3. **Summon Heroes**: Select two heroes to create a new hero
4. **Pay Fees**: CRYSTAL/JEWEL required based on hero generation

## Amba (Crystal Infusion)

**Location:** Portal (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Infuse heroes with CRYSTAL for stat boosts and enhancements  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/amba.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Amba performs crystal infusions. I tried to calculate the marginal utility of each infusion tier. Three spreadsheets later, I realized I was overthinking it.

She watched me struggle for an hour, then said, "Some improvements you feel more than you measure." I hate when philosophical wisdom conflicts with quantitative analysis. Still got the infusion, though.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Portal** area in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Amba (Crystal Infusion)**
3. **Select Hero**: Choose hero to enhance
4. **Choose Infusion Type**: Different infusions provide different bonuses

## Esoteric Wanderer

**Location:** Meditation Circle (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Manage hero meditation, gene rerolling, and level modifications  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/esoteric-wanderer.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Esoteric Wanderer. "Gaia is life. Life is change. All rebirth requires death." Philosophically fascinating. Economically terrifying.

I once calculated the probability distribution of beneficial gene rerolls. The Wanderer asked if I was "ready to embrace uncertainty." I said yes while clutching my spreadsheet. Rolled excellent genes. The universe rewards foolish confidence sometimes.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Meditation Circle** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Esoteric Wanderer**
3. **Start Meditation**: Begin meditation session for stat changes
4. **Complete Meditation**: Finish meditation to apply changes

### Tips

**Location:** Tavern (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Manage hero-for-hire system and rental listings  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/treathor.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Treathor runs the hero rental market. I built a model to optimize rental pricing based on hero stats, quest types, and seasonal demand. Treathor called it "impressively complicated."

He makes more CRYSTAL listing heroes with gut feel pricing than I do with algorithmic optimization. I choose to believe my model is ahead of its time rather than fundamentally flawed.

### Hedge's Memory
Enderdain, the barkeep. "Welcome, dear traveler. Rest your roots here, and drink in the ferment of grape, wheat, and honey." I appreciate a man who understands the value of good record-keeping and better refreshments.

### Hedge's Memory
Mr. B. "Come closer my friend and cast your eyes upon the wonders in my chest of Visages! Where did they come from? Ee-hee-hee wouldn't you like to know..."

### Hedge's Memory
Elmer manages Void Hunts. "The Druidic High Council to investigate reports of Void Shards. These powerful artifacts seem to have implanted themselves in various creatures..."

I calculated the expected value of Void Hunt participation. Then I factored in daily raffle odds. Then I stopped calculating and just went hunting. Sometimes the adventure is worth more than the spreadsheet says.

**Function:** Stake JEWEL tokens for cJEWEL, earn rewards, participate in governance  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/jeweler.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Jeweler. Where I stake my JEWEL and pretend I understand tokenomics. I've modeled the staking APY seventeen different ways. Each time I conclude it's profitable. Each time I second-guess the model.

Then the rewards accumulate and I remember: sometimes you just stake and let the mathematics work itself out. The Jeweler doesn't judge my anxiety. Professional.

**Function:** Transfer locked CRYSTAL between wallets  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/manager-dorarulir.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Manager Dorarulir. "There's nae place more secure than a dwarven vault." I respect the confidence. I also respect the 72-hour lockdown and irreversible transfer warnings.

I've never had to use the locked CRYSTAL transfer. But knowing a dwarven vault manager has my back? That's worth something you can't quantify in a spreadsheet.
