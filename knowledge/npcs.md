## Druid

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Manage liquidity pools - add/remove liquidity, view pool statistics  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/druid.png`

### Hedge's Memory
I've spent more time with the Druid than I care to admit. Lovely fellow, really. Terrible at small talk. I once tried to discuss the philosophical implications of impermanent loss with him. He just stared at me and said, "Would you like to add liquidity?"

That day I learned two things: Druids are focused professionals, and impermanent loss is neither philosophical nor temporary when you pick the wrong pool.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Druid** NPC
3. **Add Liquidity**: Deposit token pairs (e.g., CRYSTAL-JEWEL) to earn LP tokens
4. **Remove Liquidity**: Withdraw your tokens from pools
5. **View Pools**: See current APRs, TVL, and your positions
6. **Important**: You'll receive LP tokens representing your pool share - keep them safe!

### Tips
- Always check the pool APR before adding liquidity
- Understand impermanent loss before depositing
- Your LP tokens must be staked in gardens (quests) to earn rewards
- The Druid shows the same data as the Seed Box, just in a different format

## Seed Box

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** View garden pool data and your LP positions  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/seed-box.png`

### Hedge's Memory
The Seed Box. Beautiful piece of carpentry. I once spent an entire afternoon verifying the Seed Box numbers against the Druid's ledger. Every figure matched perfectly - APRs, TVL, rewards, all of it.

Three hours of my life I'll never get back, but at least I can confirm with absolute certainty that a wooden box doesn't lie. Which is more than I can say for some of the "investment opportunities" I've reviewed.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on the **Seed Box**
3. Browse all available garden pools
4. View pool details: token pairs, APRs, TVL
5. See your active LP positions and pending rewards
6. Click a pool to see detailed statistics

### Tips
- The Seed Box is great for quick overview of all pools
- Shows both Fee APR and Distribution APR separately
- Use this to compare pools before committing liquidity
- Same data as the Druid, just easier to browse all at once

## Harvest

**Location:** The Gardens (Crystalvale)  
**Function:** Claim your distribution rewards from staked LP tokens  
**Image:** `knowledge/npcs/harvest.png`

### Hedge's Memory
Ah, Harvest. My favorite time of the fiscal quarter. I remember my first harvest - I'd been meticulously tracking projected yields in a spreadsheet for weeks. The actual distribution came through and was 0.3% different from my projection.

I spent two days auditing the blockchain to find the discrepancy. Turned out I'd forgotten to account for compounding in hour 427 of a 720-hour cycle. The Harvest station didn't judge me. It just handed over the CRYSTAL and JEWEL like the professional it is.

Still use that spreadsheet, though. Now it's accurate.

### How to Use
1. Visit the **Gardens** in Crystalvale
2. Click on **Harvest**
3. View your pending rewards (CRYSTAL and JEWEL emissions)
4. Click **Claim** to harvest rewards to your wallet
5. Rewards accumulate from your staked LP tokens in garden quests

### Tips
- Rewards accumulate continuously while LP tokens are staked
- Harvesting costs a small gas fee (transaction cost)
- Consider letting rewards accumulate to reduce gas fees
- Distribution APR varies by pool - check before staking
- CRYSTAL and JEWEL are distributed separately based on pool configuration
