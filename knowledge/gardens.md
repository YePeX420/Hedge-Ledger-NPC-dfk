# DeFi Kingdoms - Gardens (Liquidity Pools) Knowledge Base

## What Are Gardens?

Gardens in DeFi Kingdoms are **liquidity pools (LPs)** where players can:
- Provide liquidity (deposit token pairs)
- Earn trading fees
- Earn JEWEL/CRYSTAL rewards
- Use heroes to increase yields via Gardening quests

## Popular LP Pairs

### Serendale (Harmony) - JEWEL-based
- **JEWEL-ONE**: Native token + native chain token
- **JEWEL-USDC**: Native token + stablecoin
- **JEWEL-ETH**: Native token + wrapped ETH
- **JEWEL-WBTC**: Native token + wrapped BTC

### Crystalvale (DFK Chain) - CRYSTAL-based
- **CRYSTAL-JADE**: Native tokens
- **CRYSTAL-USDC**: Native token + stablecoin
- **CRYSTAL-AVAX**: Native token + AVAX
- **CRYSTAL-WETH**: Native token + wrapped ETH

## How Gardens Work

### Providing Liquidity
1. Navigate to the **Druid** in Serendale or **Gardens** section
2. Select an LP pair (e.g., CRYSTAL-USDC)
3. Deposit equal USD value of both tokens
4. Receive LP tokens representing your share
5. Stake LP tokens to earn rewards

### Yield Sources
1. **Trading Fees**: ~0.25-0.3% per swap, distributed to LP holders
2. **Token Emissions**: JEWEL or CRYSTAL rewards distributed to stakers
3. **Gardening Quest Bonuses**: Deploy heroes to boost your personal yield

## APR Calculation

### Formula
```
APR = (Annual Rewards / LP Value) × 100

Daily Yield = Amount × (APR / 100) / 365
Weekly Yield = Daily Yield × 7
Monthly Yield = Daily Yield × 30
```

### APR Components
- **Base APR**: From token emissions
- **Trading Fee APR**: From swap fees (variable)
- **Hero Boost**: Additional % from hero gardening quests

### Important Notes
- APRs are **dynamic** and change based on:
  - Total liquidity in the pool
  - Token emissions schedule
  - Trading volume
- Always check current APR before depositing
- Historical APR ≠ future APR

## Impermanent Loss (IL)

### What Is It?
Loss compared to just holding tokens when prices diverge.

### When It Happens
- If one token in the pair goes up/down significantly vs. the other
- Example: You deposit CRYSTAL-USDC at $1 CRYSTAL. If CRYSTAL goes to $5, you'd have made more just holding CRYSTAL.

### Mitigation
- Choose pairs with correlated assets (e.g., stablecoin pairs)
- Pairs with same-direction price movement (CRYSTAL-JADE both game tokens)
- Earn enough APR to offset potential IL
- Understand your risk tolerance

## Gardening Quests

### How to Use Heroes in Gardens
1. Deposit LP tokens in a garden
2. Go to **Professions** → **Gardening**
3. Select your LP position
4. Assign heroes with high INT/WIS
5. Heroes boost your personal yield

### Best Heroes for Gardening
- **Wizards**: Highest INT, best gardeners
- **Priests**: High WIS, excellent support
- **Sages**: INT + LCK combo
- **Summoners**: WIS + LCK

### Yield Boost Formula (Approximate)
```
Boost % = (Hero INT + Hero WIS + Hero Level) × Profession Level × Multipliers
```
Higher level heroes with Gardening profession unlocked = bigger bonus.

## Getting Started with Gardens

### Step 1: Choose a Pair
- Beginners: Start with stablecoin pairs (lower IL risk)
- Moderate: CRYSTAL-USDC or JEWEL-USDC (one volatile, one stable)
- Advanced: Dual volatile (CRYSTAL-JADE, JEWEL-ONE)

### Step 2: Acquire Tokens
- Buy tokens on the in-game **Trader** (DEX)
- Bridge tokens from other chains
- Earn tokens via quests

### Step 3: Add Liquidity
- Go to **Druid** or **Gardens**
- Select pair, enter amount (auto-balances)
- Confirm transaction
- You'll receive LP tokens

### Step 4: Stake LP Tokens
- In the same interface, stake your LP tokens
- Start earning base APR immediately

### Step 5: Assign Heroes (Optional)
- If you own heroes, assign them to boost yields
- Higher INT/WIS = better bonuses

## Withdrawing from Gardens

### Process
1. Unstake LP tokens (may have a cooldown depending on realm)
2. Remove liquidity to get your original tokens back
3. You receive both tokens based on current pool ratio

### Important
- You might not get the **exact same amount** of each token due to price changes
- You will have earned fees + rewards during your time staking
- Calculate your total return including IL

## Risk Factors

1. **Impermanent Loss**: Price divergence between paired tokens
2. **Smart Contract Risk**: Always a possibility in DeFi
3. **Token Price Volatility**: JEWEL/CRYSTAL prices can swing
4. **APR Fluctuation**: Yields change based on emissions and TVL

## Tips for Garden Success

- **Start small** to learn mechanics
- **Diversify** across multiple pairs if possible
- **Use high-INT heroes** for gardening to maximize returns
- **Monitor APRs** - they change frequently
- **Understand IL** before committing large amounts
- **Compound rewards** - reinvest yields for exponential growth
- **Long-term mindset** - Gardens work best over months, not days
