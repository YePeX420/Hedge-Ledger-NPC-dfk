📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 4 — CATEGORY 4: OWNERSHIP & COLLECTION + CATEGORY 5: CRAFTING

These two categories represent the core identity-building and power-scaling systems of mid→late game progression.

Category 4 = Who you ARE (your roster, pets, items, collection depth)

Category 5 = What you BUILD (crafting, refining, forging)


Together, these categories define the backbone of a player’s account identity beyond simple activity or PvE.


---

============================================

CATEGORY 4 — OWNERSHIP & COLLECTION

============================================

This category answers the question:

> “What does this player have? What is their footprint in the Kingdom?”



Ownership reflects:

progress

investment

collection depth

strategic planning

long-term identity


It should not be grindable or tied to daily loops — ownership changes slowly, making it an excellent stability signal.


---

4.1 — House of Heroes

Total hero roster size (cluster-wide).

Tiered: BASIC → ADVANCED → ELITE → EXALTED


---

🎯 Design Intent

This is the simplest ownership metric, and the foundation of identity.
More heroes typically = deeper participation in:

quests

professions

hunting

summoning

crafting

tournaments



---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Hero count is highly skewed → must use percentiles

Multi-wallet smurfing must aggregate → cluster identity

Must exclude temporarily borrowed heroes (rentals, delegation if added)



---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:

hero_count = number_of_unique_heroes_owned_by_cluster

Tiering:
Percentile-based across global population.

ETL Requirements:

Pull hero ownership from chain

Deduplicate cluster-level



---

🧾 Redline (4.1 House of Heroes)

> 4.1 House of Heroes
Measures total heroes owned cluster-wide. Excludes rentals or temporary delegations. Tiering uses percentile ranks. Represents the foundational ownership footprint of an account.




---

4.2 — Hero Legion

Total combined hero levels across cluster.

Tiered


---

🎯 Design Intent

Hero Legion measures power, not quantity.

A player with:

5 level 20 heroes
has a stronger Legion than a player with

25 level 1 heroes.


This challenge captures effective roster strength.


---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Levels evolve slowly → makes a stable metric

Avoid overlap with House of Heroes (quantity)



---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:

hero_legion_score = sum(hero.level for all cluster heroes)

Tiered.


---

🧾 Redline

> 4.2 Hero Legion
Sums the levels of all cluster-owned heroes to measure aggregate roster strength. Tiered. Distinct from total hero count.




---

4.3 — Hero Curator (Class Diversity Mastery)

Measures breadth of class ownership, weighted by rarity + tier.

Tiered


---

🎯 Design Intent

Reward collection depth:

basic classes

advanced classes

elite classes

exalted classes


Players who intentionally collect across class families should be recognized.


---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Must avoid duplicating Exalted Collector (mutation-based).
Hero Curator is ONLY about class diversity, not genetic depth.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:
Weighted diversity score:

Basic class = 1  
Advanced = 3  
Elite = 5  
Exalted = 8

Compute:

hero_curator_score = sum(weight for each unique class owned)

Tiered.


---

🧾 Redline

> 4.3 Hero Curator
Measures ownership diversity across class tiers. Uses weighted scoring (Basic=1, Advanced=3, Elite=5, Exalted=8) for each unique class the cluster owns. Tiered. Represents class breadth in hero collection.




---

4.4 — Pet Collector

Weighted pet rarity ownership score.

Tiered


---

🎯 Design Intent

Pets are a major identity layer.
This measures collection prestige.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Use rarity weights:

Pet Rarity	Weight

Common	1
Uncommon	2
Rare	4
Legendary	8
Mythic	16


Metric:

pet_collector_score = sum(weight of each pet owned)

Tiered.


---

🧾 Redline

> 4.4 Pet Collector
Measures pet ownership using rarity-weight scoring. Tiered. Distinct from pet variants, bonuses, or hatching actions.




---

4.5 — Exalted Collector

Own elite/exalted heroes with significant mutation depth.

Tiered (but very high bar)


---

🎯 Design Intent

Represent elite hero ownership:

top-tier classes

heavy genetic mutations

high-power outliers


This is the “rare bloodline collector” challenge.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

A hero qualifies as “exalted” if:

(class in {Dragoon, Sage, Spellbow, Dreadknight}
 OR rarity == Mythic)
AND mutation_count >= 3

Metric:

exalted_count = number_of_heroes_meeting_criteria

Tiered (low global distribution).


---

🧾 Redline

> 4.5 Exalted Collector
Counts heroes owned that meet both class/rarity excellence and gene-depth requirements (elite/exalted class or Mythic rarity, AND ≥3 genetic mutations). Tiered. Represents apex hero ownership.




---

4.6 — Item Collector

Weighted score of owned equipment items.

Tiered


---

🎯 Design Intent

Future DFK will have full equipment trees.
This challenge measures equipment ownership depth.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Weighted formula:

item_score = rarity_weight × tier_multiplier × variant_multiplier

Where:

rarity: Common=1 … Mythic=16

tier: T1=1, T2=1.5, T3=2

variants: normal=1, cosmetic=1.5, mythic cosmetic=2


Metric:

sum(item_score for all unique items)


---

🧾 Redline

> 4.6 Item Collector
Measures owned equipment using a weighted formula (rarity × tier × variant). Tiered. Future-proofed for equipment expansions.




---

✔ CATEGORY 4 COMPLETE

Ownership defines identity and midgame power expression.

Next, we introduce the major late-midgame progression system:


---

============================================

CATEGORY 5 — CRAFTING CHALLENGES

============================================

Crafting is where players learn depth, resource integration, and multi-step systems.
This category builds sustained engagement for late-midgame players.


---

5.1 — Crystal Crafter

(Upgrading Lessers → Regulars → Greaters)


---

🎯 Design Intent

Reward refinement behavior in crystal crafting.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:

crystal_upgrades_lifetime

Tiered.


---

5.2 — Rune Forger

(Crafting actions using Shvas, Moksha, DE, etc.)

Weighted:

Shvas = 1  
Moksha = 3  
Divine Essence = 5

Metric:

rune_forge_score

Tiered.


---

5.3 — Master Forger

(Forging equipment with tier weights)

Weights:

T1=1  
T2=3  
T3=7  
Reforges = 0.5 × tier_weight

Metric:

master_forge_score

Tiered.


---

5.4 — Arcane Refiner

(Refining rare materials into catalysts)

Weighted refinement:

Basic=1  
Rare=5  
Boss relic conversion=7  
Ascension catalyst=10

Metric:

arcane_refine_score

Tiered.


---

5.5 — Crafting Veteran

(Number of unique recipes used)
Metric:

unique_crafting_recipes_used

Tiered.


---

5.7 — Forge Masterpiece (Prestige Feat)

(Complete a multi-stage 3+ step crafting pipeline)

    unlock Masterpiece

Prestige, one-time.
