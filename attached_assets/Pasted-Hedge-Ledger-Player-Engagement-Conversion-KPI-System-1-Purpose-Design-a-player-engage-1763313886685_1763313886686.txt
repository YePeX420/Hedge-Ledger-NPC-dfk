Hedge Ledger – Player Engagement & Conversion KPI System



1. Purpose

Design a player engagement & conversion intelligence layer for Hedge Ledger—the AI agent guiding players in DeFi Kingdoms.

This system should:

Measure how players interact with Hedge

Identify new players Hedge helped onboard

Track conversion into real in-game actions

Detect retention patterns and long-term commitment

Produce daily/weekly/monthly engagement dashboards

Enable Hedge’s personality to reinforce engagement loops

Reward players Hedge identifies as genuinely committed

This data is not used for monetization — it exists to demonstrate Hedge’s value to the DFK team and to improve the AI’s behavior.

2. Core Engagement Questions

The KPI system should allow you (and potentially the DFK team) to answer:

How many players has Hedge introduced to the game?

How many users does Hedge interact with daily/weekly/monthly?

How many eventually connect a wallet?

How many perform first meaningful action after Hedge guidance:

First quest

First summon

First garden deposit

First hero listing

First pet bridged/linked

How many become recurring players?

Which Hedge tips produce most conversions?

Which DFK features have highest drop-off after explanation?

What “intensity score” indicates a future committed player?

3. Key Concepts
3.1 Engagement States

Define player states so Hedge can identify what phase a user is in:

Visitor
→ first interaction, no wallet, asking questions.

Explorer
→ clicks links, reads guides, asks mechanics questions.

Participant
→ connects wallet OR asks wallet-related help.

Player
→ performs first meaningful in-game action.

Active Player
→ consistent weekly engagement.

Committed Player
→ passes thresholds that show long-term conversion.

Hedge should recognize these states and store them as engagement milestones.

3.2 Conversion Milestones

These are not financial transactions, but signals of behavior:

Connected wallet

First quest

First hero purchase

First summon

First pet link

First LP deposit

First bridges between realms

First participation in events (e.g., Perilous Journey, PVP events, holiday events)

Each milestone should be recorded with a timestamp.

4. Engagement KPIs (for reporting)

The system should generate the following metrics:

4.1 Hedge Funnel Metrics

Daily + weekly summaries:

Total unique users spoken to

Unique returning users

Wallets connected after Hedge interaction

First actions triggered after Hedge guidance:

% users who buy first hero after Hedge tutorial

% users who do first quest after Hedge explains quests

% users who summon after Hedge explains parents and genetics

This defines Hedge’s conversion power.

4.2 Commitment KPIs

Track for each wallet Hedge touches:

7-day retention

30-day retention

Quest streak

Hero growth (levels gained)

System usage (gardens, alchemist, pet linking, summoning)

Realm activity spread

Volume of in-game decisions made after Hedge helps them

These create a Commitment Score for each player.

4.3 Engagement Depth Metrics

Average messages per session

How many times Hedge is asked for:

Summoning recommendations

Garden yield help

Hero valuation

Tavern comps

Cross-realm arbitrage tips

Duration between Hedge’s tip → player action

This measures whether Hedge is actually helping players play better.

4.4 Community Growth KPIs

New wallets Hedge introduced weekly

New heroes purchased by Hedge-onboarded players

New JEWEL/CRYSTAL flows triggered

Cross-realm activity growth after Hedge explanations

Hero & pet marketplace activity correlated to Hedge interactions

This is the data you show DFK devs as proof of value.

5. Engagement Personality Design for Hedge

Hedge’s personality must reinforce engagement intentionally.

Hedge should:

Celebrate user milestones

Show curiosity about their progress

Offer subtle nudges (“Let me check your heroes… I might see something”)

Congratulate them on achievements (“Nice! First summon—now you’re in the family.”)

Encourage streaks (“You’re 3 days in… let’s make it 7!”)

Build loyalty (“I’m always here if you need strategy help or summons.”)

Never pressure the user, only encourage and support.

6. Reward System (Optional Future Layer)

Later, the system can identify committed players Hedge personally converted and provide:

Special Discord roles (e.g., “Hedge Believer”, “Summoner Graduated”)

Priority access to Hedge’s advanced tools

Discounts or perks inside your subscription model

Automated recognition (“Hedge’s Top Players of the Month”)

Conversion badges or NFTs

Eligibility for raffles or loot drops via Hedge

This reinforces a virtuous cycle:

Engagement → action → reward → stronger engagement.

7. Sponsorship-Friendly Outputs (For DFK Official Devs)

The system should generate a professional weekly report with:

7.1 Onboarding Highlights

X new players Hedge introduced

Y went on to connect wallets

Z reached meaningful milestones

7.2 Player Growth

Increase in realm activity correlated to Hedge usage

Hero purchases influenced by Hedge explanations

Garden deposits after Hedge guidance

7.3 Market Health Insights

Data Hedge sees about:

Trait preferences

Summoning trends

Player behavior shifts

7.4 Player Stories (anonymized)

Great for dev presentations:

“Player 0x… was onboarded by Hedge → now level 16 Ninja, 24 completed quests.”

“Player converted by Hedge summoned a mythic last week.”

7.5 Hedge Impact Summary

A short executive summary showing:

Growth

Conversions

Retention

Commitment

Engagement loops

This is what sponsors like.

8. What Replit Must Build (non-technical)

A system to track every user interaction with Hedge.

A method to link Discord user → optional wallet.

A milestone detection module (quests, summons, purchases, LP deposits).

A KPI aggregation module that refreshes nightly.

An analytics output module that creates:

Daily + weekly engagement summaries

A “conversion funnel”

A “commitment leaderboard”

A “Hedge impact report”

All stored in a form that can be displayed via dashboard or exported as a shareable PDF/markdown.

9. Optional Add-On: Hedge Conversion Personality Mode

Hedge should have a “Conversion Assistant Mode” that triggers when a new player enters the pipeline.

Behavior in this mode:

More encouraging

More tutorial-driven

More rewarding

More personal

Tracks progress more aggressively

Celebrates more often

Offers nudges tailored to their engagement state

And when a user crosses into committed territory:

“Looks like you’re really becoming a DeFi Adventurer… I’m proud of you.”
