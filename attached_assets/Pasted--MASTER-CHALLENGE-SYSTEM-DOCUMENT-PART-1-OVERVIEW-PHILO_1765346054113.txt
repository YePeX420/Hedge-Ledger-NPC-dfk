📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 1 — OVERVIEW, PHILOSOPHY, ENGINE, AND STRUCTURE


---

0. Executive Overview

This document defines the entire Challenge System for the DeFi Kingdoms (DFK) + METIS multi-chain ecosystem, designed for:

Player progression

Behavior modeling

Engagement tracking

Competitive classification

Prestige identity

Achievement rewarding

Tournament structuring

Leaderboard segmentation

Hedge/NPC personalization

Data-driven insights

Onboarding automation


This system organizes all player-visible challenges into 15 ordered categories, arranged from:

✔ Beginner → Expert

✔ Boring → Epic

✔ Shallow → Deep

✔ Short-term → Lifetime

✔ Low emotional impact → High emotional impact

The system is also designed to:

✔ Support multi-wallet clusters

✔ Prevent smurf abuse

✔ Use percentile tiering

✔ Allow dynamic, configurable tuning

✔ Scale to future DFK systems

✔ Align with Hedge’s training, engagement, and reward systems

This is the canonical, master-level specification for all current and future Challenge Pass, Leaderboards, and Player Segmentation.

1. System Philosophy — The Player Journey

The challenge system must tell a story:

A new player enters the Kingdom

They explore basic loops (quests, eggs, communication)

They grow into professions and hunting

They acquire heroes, pets, items

They begin forging, summoning, crafting

They enter PvP

They step into METIS — patrols, shells, influence

They compete in METIS tournaments

They pursue prestige feats

They eventually reach mythical, epic achievements


In this sense, the category order is a narrative progression path, not just a list of features.

A player should FEEL progression while browsing challenge categories —
like looking at a skill tree or RPG class path.

2. Core Structure — 15 Challenge Categories

Ordered by gameplay depth and emotional weight:

1. Core Gameplay Engagement (Beginner)


2. Profession Mastery (Early Game Progression)


3. Hunting Challenges (Mid Game PvE)


4. Ownership & Collection (Mid Game Identity)


5. Crafting Challenges (Mid→Late Game Systems)


6. Gold Economy Challenges (Advanced Gold Flow)


7. Summoning & Hero Development (Late Game Mastery)


8. PvP Challenges (Competitive Depth)


9. METIS Patrol Challenges (Parallel PvE)


10. METIS Shell Economy (Resource Ecosystem)


11. METIS Influence System (Prediction/Strategy)


12. METIS Tournament System (Competitive METIS Loop)


13. Seasonal & Event Challenges (Live Ops Layer)


14. Prestige Feats (Lifetime Achievements)


15. Epic Feats (Mythic Rarity Achievements)



This sequence takes a player from:

➡ “I logged in today”
to
➡ “I became the legend the Kingdom will remember.”

3. Challenge Anatomy (Universal Pattern)

Every challenge attempts to answer:

1️⃣ What behavior does it reward?

2️⃣ Who is it for? (beginner→expert)

3️⃣ Is it tiered or prestige?

4️⃣ How is data collected?

5️⃣ How does it avoid overlap with similar challenges?

6️⃣ How does it fit the category's identity?

Each challenge definition contains:

Design Intent

Issue Analysis

Recommendations

Final Specification

Tier System (if applicable)

Unlock Conditions

ETL Requirements

Cosmetic Rewards

Redline-ready final text


This structure is consistent across categories.


---

4. Tiering Engine — Percentile-Based Calibration

❗ All tiered challenges use percentile-based thresholds.

This ensures:

✔ Fairness for all players

✔ No whale inflation

✔ Automatic balance

✔ Adjusts with population growth

✔ Works across multiple chains

Tier labels:

Basic (bottom 40%)

Advanced (40–70%)

Elite (70–90%)

Exalted (90–99% or 95–99% depending on challenge)


Prestige feats do not use tiers — they unlock once.


---

5. Cluster Identity Model — Anti-Smurfing Engine

Players often use multiple wallets.
To prevent smurfing:

✔ ALL challenge scoring occurs at the cluster level,

not the wallet level.

Cluster = all wallets linked to the same user.

Cluster-based scoring ensures:

✔ Tournament fairness

✔ Influence accuracy

✔ PvP ranking integrity

✔ Behavioral modeling accuracy

✔ No dilution of achievements

✔ Prevents challenge abuse

Cluster identity uses:

PlayerID

Linked wallets

Linked Discord ID

Linked profile login(s)


This also enhances Hedge’s personalization layer.


---

6. Open Configuration Tables — Dynamic Game Integration

The Challenge System supports future expansions with configurable open lists:

🔹 META_COMPOSITION_TABLE

Tracks meta PvP team compositions for “Meta Breaker (12.6)”

🔹 CLUCKER_DROP_TABLE

Motherclucker-exclusive drops

🔹 BOAR_DROP_TABLE

Mad Boar-exclusive drops

🔹 RELIC_DROP_TABLE

Ultra-rare hunting relics

🔹 BLACKSMITH_EQUIPMENT_IDS

Items purchased from Armorsmith/Weaponsmith vendors

🔹 GEAR_ENHANCEMENT_METHODS

Equipment enhancement/repair/upgrade actions

🔹 CRAFTING_RECIPE_GRAPH

Directed acyclic graph mapping multi-step crafting pipelines

🔹 TOURNAMENT_EVENT_IDS

Defining official METIS tournaments

🔹 TOURNAMENT_MATCH_RESULT_IDS

Defining “match won” results

🔹 TOURNAMENT_CHAMPION_CRITERIA

Per-event champion placement thresholds

These allow you to update the game without rewriting challenge code.

7. ETL Framework — Extraction, Transformation, Load

The Challenge System relies on a modular ETL pipeline:

✔ Extract

Wallet events

Summon logs

Hunt results

Patrol results

Crafting transactions

Pet hatches

Influence bet logs

Tournament entries & match outcomes

Resource drops

Marketplace interactions


✔ Transform

Cluster association

Weighted calculations

Mutation detection

Rarity classification

Variant identification

PvP team meta evaluation

Challenge-specific metrics


✔ Load

Challenge progress table

Tier assignments

Achievement unlocks

Score snapshots

Seasonal logs


ETL is domain-driven — each challenge category maps cleanly to specific extractors.
