We want to eliminate confusion around the word “Prestige” by clearly separating three concepts:

1) Challenges (rolling, tiered)
2) Founder’s Mark (permanent peak-tier marker per challenge)
3) Feats (lifetime binary accomplishments)

Please apply the following changes at the UI and API layer (no breaking ETL or scoring changes required right now).

====================================================
1) Rename “Prestige Challenges” → “Feats”
====================================================

- Anywhere in the UI, admin, or API responses that currently refers to “Prestige Challenges” should be renamed to “Feats”.
- Feats are:
  - Lifetime
  - Binary (locked / unlocked)
  - Not tiered
  - Not rolling
  - Not part of season scoring or calibration
- Update headers, tabs, tooltips, and copy accordingly.
- Do NOT change underlying DB tables yet; this is a naming/UX refactor.

====================================================
2) Introduce “Founder’s Mark” for Challenges
====================================================

- A Founder’s Mark is a permanent marker indicating that a player has **ever achieved the top tier** (e.g. Mythic) for a given Challenge.
- Founder’s Marks:
  - Are evaluated from historical tier results
  - Once earned, are never removed
  - Are independent of the current rolling tier
  - Are purely visual/identity markers

Backend/API:
- Add (or expose if already present):
  - founders_mark (boolean)
  - founders_mark_at (timestamp, optional)
- These fields should be returned with the challenge progress payload.

====================================================
3) UI Behavior
====================================================

Challenge Cards:
- Show current tier emblem based on rolling window (e.g. 180d).
- If founders_mark === true:
  - Render a permanent “Founder’s Mark” border or overlay on the card.
  - This border remains even if the current tier drops.

Feats Page:
- Display Feats separately from Challenges.
- Each Feat shows Locked / Unlocked state only.
- No tiers, no progress bars, no calibration.

====================================================
4) Remove “Prestige” Terminology from Player-Facing UI
====================================================

- Replace all player-facing uses of “Prestige” with:
  - “Feats” (for lifetime accomplishments)
  - “Founder’s Mark” (for peak-tier achievement)
- The word “Prestige” should not appear in player-facing challenge UI.

====================================================
5) Validation
====================================================

Confirm:
- A Challenge with rolling tiers shows:
  - Current Tier (from rolling window)
  - Founder’s Mark if previously achieved top tier
- A Feat shows only Locked / Unlocked
- No tier ladders appear on Feats
- Calibration and simulation continue to apply only to Challenges
