📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 2 — CATEGORY 1 (Core Engagement) + CATEGORY 2 (Professions)

(Beginner → Early Game Progression)


---

============================================

CATEGORY 1 — CORE GAMEPLAY ENGAGEMENT

============================================

This category introduces new players to the Kingdom and rewards:

logging in

taking daily actions

using Discord/Hedge

receiving first drops

early-game pet interaction


These challenges build foundational connection → they are simple, low-friction, and highly encouraging.

They provide identity and early progression without requiring hero depth, tokens, or mastery.


---

1.1 — Active Adventurer

Tracks the number of days a player performs ANY meaningful action.


---

🎯 Design Intent

This challenge measures long-term consistency, not skill or grinding.
It serves as the “engaged player” metric.

A player is counted “active” on a day if ANY of the following occurs:

quests

hunting

meditation

summoning

crafting

forging

pet hatching

gold-cycling actions

METIS patrol

PvP matches

tournament matches

influence bets

shell raffle participation


The goal:
Reward showing up.


---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Issue 1 — Streaks vs. Activity

Quest streaks exist elsewhere →
This challenge should not use streak logic → only total active days.

Issue 2 — Bots

Expeditions w/ JEWEL lock count (intentional), but pure bots or passive hold wallets do not.

Issue 3 — Multi-Wallet Clusters

Daily activity is cluster-wide.


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:

active_days_lifetime = number_of_days_with_any_cluster_activity

Tiering:
Percentile-based

Basic

Advanced

Elite

Exalted


ETL Requirements:

Daily snapshot

Activity boolean flags

Cluster aggregation


Cosmetics:

“Adventurer’s Step” badge

“Explorer’s Crest” frame



---

(Discord Engagement + Hedge Interaction)


---

🎯 Design Intent

This challenge identifies:

socially active players

learners

players engaging with Hedge tutorials

community pillars

---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Issue 1 — No message-count spam

Use meaningful categories:

Hedge commands

onboarding completions

event participation

helpful interactions

direct questions answered


Issue 2 — Cluster ID alignment

Discord ID must map to cluster.

Issue 3 — Seasonal resets unnecessary

This is a lifetime metric.


---

    hedge_commands_used (1)
  + onboarding_steps_completed (5)

---

---

1.4 — Hatch Master

(Early hatching actions)


---

🎯 Design Intent

taking the risk of RNG outcomes

generating their first pet



---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

Metric:

hatch_count_lifetime

Tiered
Percentile-based.


---

✔ CATEGORY 1 COMPLETED

Great work — now we progress into the early-game systems involving professions.


---

============================================

CATEGORY 2 — PROFESSION MASTERY CHALLENGES

============================================

Professions are the first true game loop after quests.
This category rewards repetitive, stamina-based, resource-generating loops.

These challenges build medium-term identity.


---

player may miss 1 day without breaking the streak.
Then 1 more day allowed every 2 weeks.

Grace logic

Cluster aggregation
