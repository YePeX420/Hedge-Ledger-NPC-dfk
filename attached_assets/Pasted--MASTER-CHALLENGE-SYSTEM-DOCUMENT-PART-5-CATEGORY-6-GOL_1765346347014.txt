📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 5 — CATEGORY 6 (GOLD ECONOMY) + CATEGORY 7 (SUMMONING & HERO DEVELOPMENT)

(Advanced Core Systems → Late Game Mastery)

This part contains two of the most important mid→late game pillars:

Category 6 — the Gold Economy, DFK’s foundational non-crypto economy

Category 7 — the Summoning & Hero Development mastery, arguably the deepest long-term system in the game


These categories bridge the gap between a functional midgame account and a late-game powerhouse.
