You are helping me fix my Discord bot project. Here is what I need you to do:

1. Make sure the project has a command loader that reads EVERY file in /commands and registers their .data and .execute properties into client.commands.

2. Ensure the command /hedge-admin is registered. The file should be located at: /commands/hedgeAdmin.js and contain:
   - SlashCommandBuilder()
   - .setName('hedge-admin')
   - .setDescription('Open the Hedge Ledger admin dashboard (admins only).')
   - userIsAdmin() and admin-channel locking using process.env.OWNER_ID, process.env.ADMIN_ROLE_ID, and process.env.ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID.
   - An embed and buttons.

3. Create or fix a deploy script called deploy-commands.js at the project root. It should:
   - Load all .js files from /commands
   - Convert command.data to JSON
   - Register commands as GUILD commands for process.env.DISCORD_GUILD_ID
   - Use process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN
   - Print success message

4. The deploy script must successfully run using:
      node deploy-commands.js

5. Update the main bot file (index.js or app.js) to:
   - Load client.commands = new Collection()
   - Load commands from /commands into client.commands
   - Respond to interactionCreate:
        - If it's a chatInputCommand, call execute()
        - If it's a button, run the admin button logic found inside hedgeAdmin.js

6. Validate that the env vars are used exactly as:
   process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN
   process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
   process.env.DISCORD_GUILD_ID
   process.env.ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID
   process.env.ADMIN_ROLE_ID
   process.env.OWNER_ID

7. After fixing the project, ensure that:
   - /hedge-admin appears in Discord when typing `/`
   - The command only works in the admin channel
   - Only the owner or users with ADMIN_ROLE_ID can access it
   - Non-admins see the correct error message

8. Do not rewrite my whole project. ONLY correct the missing or broken parts needed to:
   - load commands
   - register commands
   - execute commands
   - support admin protections

Please make all changes now and show me the updated code files.
