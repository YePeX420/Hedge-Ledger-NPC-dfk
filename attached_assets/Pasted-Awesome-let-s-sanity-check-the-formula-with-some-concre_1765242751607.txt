Awesome, let’s sanity-check the formula with some **concrete player archetypes** so you can “feel” how tiers shake out.

I’ll show:

1. The **inputs** (heroes, net worth, activity, etc.)
2. The **CPS + tier result**
3. A short interpretation so you can see if it matches your intuition.

Numbers below are rounded so they’re readable; the backend will use exact math from `TierService.ts`.

## 🧒 Profile 1 – Fresh Newbie (COMMON)

**Intuition:** Brand new player, tiny bag, lightly testing the game.

**Inputs (cluster-wide):**

* Heroes:

  * 1 Common hero
  * 0 of everything else
  * ~10 total hero levels
* Wallet net worth: **~$50**
* Last 30 days:

  * ~40 profession quests
  * 0 summons
  * ~30% stamina actually used
  * 5 active days
* Account age: **10 days**
* Behavior (30d):

  * reinvest ratio: **0.2**
  * netHeroDelta: 0 (not really acquiring more heroes)
  * heavySellActivityFlag: 0

**Result (approx):**

* Composite Power Score (CPS): **≈ 11.3**
* **Tier:** `COMMON` (CPS < 20)

👉 This wallet is exactly where we want true newbies:
small CPS, clearly NOT dragged into higher tiers.

## 🌱 Profile 2 – Growing Early Player (UNCOMMON)

**Intuition:** Has put some money and time in, but still early-mid.

**Inputs:**

* Heroes:

  * 5 Common, 5 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Legendary, 0 Mythic
  * ~150 total hero levels
* Wallet: **~$500** net worth
* Activity last 30d:

  * ~300 profession quests
  * 5 summons
  * ~70% stamina used
  * 20 active days
* Account age: **~120 days** (4 months)
* Behavior:

  * reinvest ratio: **0.6**
  * netHeroDelta: +2 (actually adding heroes)
  * heavySellActivityFlag: 0

**Result:**

* CPS: **≈ 24.9**
* **Tier:** `UNCOMMON` (20 ≤ CPS < 40)

👉 This looks like a **legit growing account**:

* More engaged than a total newbie
* Still far from whale/OG territory
* Perfect candidate for **Uncommon League** bracket.

## 🛡️ Profile 3 – Established Mid-Game Player (RARE)

**Intuition:** Solid roster, noticeable bag, very active.

**Inputs:**

* Heroes:

  * 20 Common, 20 Uncommon, 20 Rare, 5 Legendary, 2 Mythic
  * ~1,500 total levels
* Wallet: **~$8,000** net worth
* Activity last 30d:

  * ~3,000 profession quests
  * 60 summons
  * ~95% stamina used
  * 30 active days (daily)
* Account age: **~400 days** (> 1 year)
* Behavior:

  * reinvest ratio: **0.8**
  * netHeroDelta: +10
  * heavySellActivityFlag: 0

**Result:**

* CPS: **≈ 47.3**
* **Tier:** `RARE` (40 ≤ CPS < 60)

👉 This is your **core mid-to-upper class**:

* Deep into the game
* Good roster, high activity
* Should not be fighting newbies, but also not yet in the “Mythic OG” bucket.
* Rare League feels right.

## 👑 Profile 4 – True OG / Whale (MYTHIC)

**Intuition:** Multi-year degen, many heroes, big bag, grinding daily, summoning like crazy.

**Inputs:**

* Heroes:

  * 80 Common, 120 Uncommon, 100 Rare, 60 Legendary, 30 Mythic
  * ~9,000 total hero levels
* Wallet: **~$200,000** net worth
* Activity last 30d:

  * ~10,000 profession quests
  * 250 summons
  * ~99% stamina used
  * 30/30 active days
* Account age: **~1,200 days** (~3+ years)
* Behavior:

  * reinvest ratio: **0.95**
  * netHeroDelta: +40
  * heavySellActivityFlag: 0

**Result:**

* CPS: **≈ 99.3**
* **Tier:** `MYTHIC` (CPS ≥ 80)

👉 This is exactly what we want `MYTHIC` to represent:

* Whale / OG power
* Extremely engaged
* Has no business in Common/Rare brackets
* Perfect “Mythic League” champion material

## 🧪 What this tells us / how to use it

1. **The thresholds feel sane**

   * New → COMMON
   * Early → UNCOMMON
   * Solid → RARE
   * Top OG → MYTHIC
     (And we also saw earlier that a strong but not insane account lands in LEGENDARY.)

2. **Smurfing gets crushed**

   * If an OG tries to strip a few heroes + tokens into a “new” wallet:

     * HPS jumps
     * WVS jumps
     * CPS quickly climbs into `RARE/LEGENDARY/MYTHIC` range
       → Smurf gets auto-bucketed into a high tier.

3. **You can still tune it**

   * If you want more people in RARE vs LEGENDARY, we just tweak:

     * normalization denominators (2500, 300, 5.0, etc.)
     * CPS thresholds (20/40/60/80)
   * But the *shape* (who is where) already looks good.

If you want next, I can:

* Turn these 4 profiles into **unit tests** for `computeBaseTierFromMetrics()` (so every deploy guarantees sane tiers), or
* Help design the **leaderboard scoring formulas** for one of your first monthly league themes (e.g., “Miner’s Rush” or “Bloodline Trials”).
