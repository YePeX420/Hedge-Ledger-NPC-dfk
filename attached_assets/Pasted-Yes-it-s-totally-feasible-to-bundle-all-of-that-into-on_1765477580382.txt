Yes, it’s totally feasible to bundle all of that into one response.
I’ll give you a single, structured document you can:

Read on your phone

Paste pieces into /docs

Turn into Replit prompts as needed


It will contain:

1. Challenge Testing Checklist


2. Season 1 Reward Structure


3. Leaderboard UI + API Design

1️⃣ Challenge Testing Checklist

(Use after ingestion + ETL are running and challenge_progress is populated.)

Goal: systematically verify that every implemented challenge matches on-chain reality and behaves as designed.

A. General Testing Flow (repeat per challenge)

For each challenge:

1. Pick a test cluster (ideally your own or a known whale/test account).


2. For that cluster:

Pull ground-truth data from:

DFK block explorer

DFK official UI

Your own game logs


Write it down: expectedValue, expectedUnlocked, expectedTier.



3. Run ETL for that cluster:

Either via:

Admin trigger (if exists)

Full ETL run (daily job)




4. Check backend:

Query challenge_progress where:

SELECT challenge_key, value, unlocked, tier
FROM challenge_progress
WHERE cluster_id = '<clusterId>' AND challenge_key = '<challengeKey>';



5. Compare to ground-truth:

If value, unlocked, tier match expectations → ✅

If not → log details, adjust ETL or config, re-run.

B. High-Priority Challenge Groups

1. Hero Progression

hero_riser (total_levels)

Expected: sum of all hero levels.


house_of_heroes (hero_count)


Checklist:

[ ] Verify hero_riser.value = actual sum of levels.

[ ] Verify house_of_heroes.value = number of heroes on-chain.

[ ] Tiers for both behave correctly at boundaries.



---

2. Profession Specialization

miner_master (mining_quests)

herbalist_master (foraging_quests)


Checklist:

[ ] Verify number of Mining quests matches on-chain.

[ ] Verify number of Foraging quests matches.

[ ] Confirm no double-counting of partial/cancelled quests.



---

3. Behavior & Engagement

kingdom_calls (active_days)

loyal_follower (discord_engagement_score)

long_road_home (account_age_days)


Checklist:

[ ] active_days reflects days with any activity (see ETL logic).

[ ] account_age_days matches earliest known DFK activity (we already validated once).

[ ] Discord score increases with Hedge/Discord actions.



---

4. Hunting PvE

hunters_triumph (wins)

motherclucker_slayer (motherclucker_kills)

mad_boar_slayer (mad_boar_kills)

relic_tracker (relics_found)

clucker_miracle (boolean)


Checklist:

[ ] Confirm number of MC & Mad Boar wins is correct.

[ ] Confirm relic count matches known high-tier drops.

[ ] For a known miracle fight:

On-chain: 1 hero survives at 1 HP →

challenge_progress: clucker_miracle.value = 1, unlocked = true.




---

5. PvP Competition

arena_challenger (matches_played)

arena_victor (wins)

win_streak (best_win_streak)

flawless_victory (boolean)


Checklist:

[ ] matches_played equals number of ranked matches.

[ ] wins equals number of ranked wins.

[ ] best_win_streak matches manual streak check from match list.

[ ] flawless_victory equals 1 when there is at least one 0-death win.



---

6. Summoning Prestige

perfect_pairing

mutagenic_specialist

mythmaker

royal_lineage

summoner_of_legends


Checklist:

For a small set of heroes with known gene data:

[ ] Perfect pairing triggers only when ≥2 mutation domains mutate upward.

[ ] mutagenic_specialist_count increments for each hero with ≥3 mutations.

[ ] mythmaker_count increments for each Mythic summon.

[ ] royal_lineage_count increments only when both parents and child meet mutation conditions.

[ ] summoner_of_legends unlocks only when all 4 classes were summoned at least once.



---

7. DeFi Participation (LP + Jeweler)

lp_depth, lp_diversified, yield_harvester, diamond_hand_lp

jeweler_stakeholder, jeweler_whale


Checklist:

[ ] For a test wallet with known LP positions, validate:

LP USD value roughly matches external DeFi UI / your own calc.

pool_count matches number of pools with non-trivial amounts.


[ ] For staking:

stake_usd_value matches Jeweler stake UI.

stake_duration_days increases as expected.

JEWEL whale unlocked when stake ≥ 10k JEWEL.




---

8. METIS + Epic + Meta Profile

Validate once underlying metrics are live:

[ ] METIS patrol wins / elite wins

[ ] Shell collector / gambler / jackpot

[ ] Influence strategist

[ ] Tournament challenger / victor / champion

[ ] Vangardian + other epic feats unlock correctly

[ ] Meta profile scores (summoning_prestige_score, pvp_mastery_score, metis_mastery_score) correlate logically with underlying metrics.



---

2️⃣ Season 1 Reward Structure

Let’s define a clean, extensible reward structure for Season 1 – The Hedge Awakens.

A. Core Design Principles

Reward both effort and prestige (not just whales).

Make Summoning + Hunting + PvP feel central.

Provide a mix of:

Cosmetic rewards

Discord roles

Small token perks (if you want)

Future NFT slots (optional)



B. Season Levels → Reward Matrix

Using the level thresholds from earlier:

Level	Points (approx)	Reward Ideas

1	0	Season 1 participation badge (everyone)
2	50	Discord emoji access or minor cosmetic tag
3	150	“Hedge Recruit” Discord role
4	300	Profile banner / frame in Hedge dashboard (Summoning-themed)
5	600	“Clucker Hunter” or “Early Adopter” Discord title
6	1000	Small token reward (e.g., 10–25 CRYSTAL/Jewel equivalent) or raffle ticket
7	1500	Special Season 1-only avatar border / pet-themed icon
8	2200	“Season 1 Veteran” Discord role + small whitelist priority if you plan future NFTs
9	3000	Access to a private Hedge strategy channel
10	4000+	Top-tier Season badge + eligibility for Season Hall of Fame leaderboard snapshot (frozen forever in a page)


You can hook these rewards into:

a season_rewards table

a manual script that checks season_progress.level after a season ends and issues:

Discord roles (via bot)

reward claims in UI




---

C. Bonus Rewards for Specific Feats in Season 1

Add special reward triggers:

Bonus A – Motherclucker Miracle

If clucker_miracle unlocked during Season 1 → mark user as “Miracle Hunter”

Discord flair + maybe 1 raffle ticket.


Bonus B – First time Summoner of Legends

Unlocks “Legendborn” role + highlight in Season recap.


Bonus C – Top 10 in Season 1 Hedge Score leaderboard

Distinct color role and/or allow them to participate in design votes.




---

3️⃣ Leaderboard UI + API Design

We already know there are backend leaderboards:

leaderboard_defs

leaderboard_runs

leaderboard_entries

/api/admin/leaderboards


Now let’s define:

Public API endpoints

Frontend layout for a Leaderboards page.


A. Public API

1. GET /api/leaderboards

Returns a list of available public leaderboards:

[
  {
    "key": "lb_season1_overall",
    "name": "Season 1 – Hedge Score",
    "description": "Weighted points from Season 1 challenges.",
    "timeWindow": "SEASON",
    "seasonKey": "season_1_the_hedge"
  },
  {
    "key": "lb_summoning_all_time",
    "name": "Top Summoners (All Time)",
    "timeWindow": "ALL_TIME"
  },
  ...
]

2. GET /api/leaderboards/:key

Fetch latest run of a leaderboard with entries:

{
  "key": "lb_season1_overall",
  "name": "Season 1 – Hedge Score",
  "timeWindow": "SEASON",
  "seasonKey": "season_1_the_hedge",
  "runId": "uuid-or-int",
  "generatedAt": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "entries": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "clusterId": "cluster-...",
      "displayName": "YePeX",
      "walletPreview": "0x1a9f...4098",
      "score": 4235,
      "flags": ["season1_veteran", "summoner_of_legends"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

This endpoint is what the FE will call.


---

B. Frontend Leaderboard Layout (React concept)

Page Route: /leaderboards and /leaderboards/:key

Main page (/leaderboards)

Left sidebar:

Leaderboard list grouped:

Season 1

PvP

Summoning

Hunting

DeFi



Main pane:

Selected leaderboard name + description

Time window info (e.g. “Season 1 (Jan 1 – Mar 31)”)

<LeaderboardTable />



<LeaderboardTable /> component

Columns:

Rank	Player / Cluster	Score	Badges	Last Updated



Rank: 1,2,3…

Player:

Show display name (if you have Discord or in-app username)

Fallback to short wallet or cluster ID


Score:

Numeric

Might include small sparkline or progress bar


Badges:

Show icons for key achievements like:

Mythmaker

Clucker Miracle

Flawless Victory



Last updated:

Show generatedAt time for run.



Optional controls:

Dropdown for time windows (if leaderboard supports multiple: DAILY, WEEKLY, etc.)

Pagination if entries > 100.



---

C. Admin → Public Link

Admin creates leaderboards in /api/admin/leaderboards

Marks some as isPublic = true

Public API only returns isPublic = true leaderboards

FE reads from public API and displays them.



---

If you want, I can next:

Turn this Leaderboard UI spec into actual React component skeletons,

Draft Discord messages for announcing Season 1 + leaderboards,

Or build a Challenge Validation Plan as a checklist-style MarkDown you can put in /docs/CHALLENGE_VALIDATION.md.
