### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#pet-1)    `Pet`

The `Pet` object type contains the following fields:

#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#basic-information)    Basic Information

- `id`: `ID` \- the Pet's ID. Crystalvale Pet IDs are padded by `1000000000000` (one trillion), and Serendale (Klaytn) IDs are padded by `2000000000000` (two trillion).

- `normalizedId`: `String` \- the ID that appears in-game without realm padding.

- `owner`: `Profile` \- the current owner of the Pet. Pets held in the [PetAuction contract](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/contracts/sales-and-rentals/pet-auction) will still return the Profile of their owner.

- `previousOwner`: `Profile` \- the most immediate recent owner of the Pet. Will return `null` if the Pet has not changed wallets since hatching.

- `creator`: `Profile` \- the player who originally hatched the Pet

- `createdAt`: `Int` \- the Unix timestamp of the Pet's hatching

- `originId`: `Int` \- deprecated

- `originRealm`: `String` \- the origin realm of the Pet; returns `SER1`, `CRY`, or `SER2`

- `currentRealm`: `String` \- the current realm of the Pet; returns `SER1`, `CRY`, or `SER2`

- `name`: `String` \- not currently in use

- `season`: `Int` \- returns the Pet's Season number

- `eggType`: `Int` \- returns `0` for Blue Egg and `1` for Grey Egg. The Pet's `eggType` determines the type of Profession Bonus that it will receive.

- `rarity`: `Int` \- maps from `0` (Common) to `4` (Mythic)

- `element`: `Int` \- maps from `0` to `7` \- multiply by 2 and use the Hero element mapping. The Pet's `element` determines the type of Crafting Bonus that it may receive.

- `appearance`: `Int` \- a mapping of the appearance of the Pet; combines with `eggType` and `season` to determine Name, Variant, Family, and other details

- `background`: `Int` \- a mapping of the background image for the Pet

- `shiny`: `Boolean` \- whether the Pet card is Shiny or not


#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#bonuses)    Bonuses

Until specific bonuses are implemented, the number of stars on the Pet card maps as follows for the Rarity of each bonus:

- `0`: no stars / no bonus

- `1`: 1 star / Common bonus

- `80`: 2 stars / Rare bonus

- `160`: 3 stars / Mythic bonus


The three `Scalar` fields for `craftBonus` and `combatBonus` are not currently in use, but will indicate the scale of the specific bonus.

- `bonusCount`: `Int` \- the number of bonuses that the Pet received


The `profBonus` field is padded by `10000 * eggType`, as outlined [here](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/nfts/pets#gathering-profession-bonus).

- `profBonus`: `Int`

- `profBonusScalar`: `Int`


The `craftBonus` field is padded by `10000 * element`, as outlined [here](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/nfts/pets#crafting-bonus).

- `craftBonus`: `Int`

- `craftBonusScalar`: `Int`

- `combatBonus`: `Int`

- `combatBonusScalar`: `Int`


#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#pet-state)    Pet State

- `hungryAt`: `Int` \- the Unix timestamp when the Pet will need to be fed to provide its bonuses to a Hero; not currently in use

- `equippableAt`: `Int` \- the Unix timestamp when the Pet will be available for equipping to a Hero; not currently in use

- `equippedTo`: `Hero` \- the Hero that the Pet is equipped to; not currently in use

- `fedBy`: `Profile` \- the Profile that last fed the Pet

- `foodType`: `Int` \- range of `0-4`, indicating Pet Treat Type (`0`: Regular; `1`: Premium), and presence of the Premium Provisions Power-Up (`2`: Regular + PU; `3`: Premium + PU)


#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#auction-details)    Auction Details

## [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#examples)    Examples

#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#example-1)    Example 1

All Uncommon Pets hatched from Grey Eggs with a two-star Armorsmithing bonus:

Copy

```
{
  pets(where: {eggType: 1, element: 2, craftBonus: 80}) {
    id
    appearance
    rarity
    profBonus
    craftBonus
    combatBonus
  }
}
```

#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#example-2)    Example 2

All Pets from the Penguin family (by `eggType`/`Appearance`) with the "Vithraven Outskirts" background, sorted by ascending Sale Price:

Copy

```
{
  pets(orderBy: salePrice, where: {eggType: 0, appearance_in: [19, 60, 61, 62, 63, 88, 101, 126], background: 3}) {
    id
    salePrice
    rarity
    appearance
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### [Direct link to heading](https://devs.defikingdoms.com/api/community-graphql-api/pets\#example-3)    Example 3

The 10 lowest-priced Rare Pets for Sale, sorted by ascending Sale Price:

Copy

```
{
  pets(first:10, orderBy:salePrice, where: {rarity: 2, salePrice_not:null}) {
    id
    salePrice
    eggType
    profBonus
    craftBonus
    combatBonus
  }
}
```

Because `Auction` and `PetAuction` queries can't filter on subfields of `tokenId`, use complex `Heroes` and `Pets` queries with a `salePrice_not: null` filter instead.
