📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 3 — CATEGORY 3: HUNTING (Mid-Game PvE System)

Category 3 represents the true mid-game transformation stage where players evolve from basic professions into combat-driven PvE loops.
Hunting introduces:

Hero stat requirements

Proper builds

Class synergy

First danger of hero death scenarios

First boss-tier fights (Motherclucker & Mad Boar)

Material drops

High-value item loops

RNG excitement

Emotional “story moments”


This is where players feel their first real sense of mastery.

============================================

CATEGORY 3 — HUNTING CHALLENGES

============================================

Hunting is intentionally positioned after professions because it:

Requires stronger heroes

Involves risk

Introduces boss fights

Produces higher-value materials

Delivers dramatic battle outcomes


This is where combat identity begins.

Let’s go challenge-by-challenge with complete detail.


---

3.1 — Hunter’s Triumph

Tracks lifetime PvE wins in the Hunting system.

Tier System: BASIC → ADVANCED → ELITE → EXALTED


---

🎯 DESIGN INTENT

Introduce players to combat loops.
Reward general participation.

This is the “core volume metric” of Hunting.


---

⚠ ISSUE ANALYSIS

Issue 1 — Whale hero count inflation

Whales can hunt more because they have more heroes.

✔ Solution:

Percentile tiers.

Issue 2 — Must not overlap with Elite Hunts

Those go into 3.2 (Apex-level)

Issue 3 — Must NOT count METIS Patrols

Patrols are their own category (15).


---

⭐ FINAL SPEC

hunting_wins_lifetime

Tiering:
Percentile-based.

Hero investment

Repeated attempts

RNG mitigation

CLUCKER_DROP_TABLE = {
  unique boss materials,
  feathers,
  equipment shards,
  event drops
}
