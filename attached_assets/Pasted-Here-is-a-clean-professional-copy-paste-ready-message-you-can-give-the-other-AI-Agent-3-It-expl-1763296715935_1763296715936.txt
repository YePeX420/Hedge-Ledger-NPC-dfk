Here is a clean, professional, copy-paste-ready message you can give the other AI (Agent 3).
It explains exactly how we were doing it, the technical approach, and asks it to focus on Crystalvale and DFK Metis (Influence System) only.

Just copy/paste the block below:

📌 PASTE THIS INTO THE OTHER AI

I already have a working method for computing pool analytics (APR, volume, fees, emissions, TVL, etc.) for DeFi Kingdoms – Crystalvale and DFK Metis (Influence System).
I need you to follow this same methodology and focus exclusively on Crystalvale and Metis pools.


---

✅ How APR, Fees, Emissions, Prices, and TVL were computed (Follow This Approach)

You do not need pool names or a static list.
Everything is discovered and calculated on-chain using the same method we already built:


---

1. Discover pools directly from the staking contract (no names needed)

Use the staking (MasterChef-style) contract:

getPoolLength()

Loop pid = 0 → poolLength-1

For each pid, call getPoolInfo(pid) to get:

lpToken address

allocPoint

totalStaked

reward rate fields (if present)



This automatically detects all Crystalvale pools and all Metis Influence pools, with no names required.


---

2. Identify underlying tokens using the LP contract

For each lpToken (UniswapV2Pair):

token0(), token1()

getReserves()

totalSupply()


This gives us exact pool composition and USD value later.


---

3. Build token prices using an on-chain pair graph (anchored to USDC or USDT)

Construct a token graph:

Nodes = tokens

Edges = LP exchange rates (reserve0/reserve1)


Anchor the price graph at:

Crystalvale → USDC.e

Metis → USDT or USDC depending on Influence Subnet availability


Use BFS to propagate all token prices.

This yields 100% on-chain USD prices for CRYSTAL, USDC, WJEWEL, AVAX, METIS-tokens, etc.


---

4. Compute 24h Fee APR using Swap logs (exact, not estimated)

For each LP pair, scan the previous 24 hours of blocks:

Filter logs for the pair’s address and the Swap event.

Decode:

amount0In, amount0Out

amount1In, amount1Out


Convert amounts → USD using our price graph.

Sum the total 24h volume in USD.


Fee revenue:

dailyFeesUSD = volume24hUSD * feeRate   (usually 0.25% for DFK)

Fee APR:

feeAPR = (dailyFeesUSD / avgStakedLiquidityUSD) * 365 * 100

This was accurate even during high-volume periods and requires no external API.


---

5. Compute Emission APR using RewardCollected events (Crystalvale + Metis Influence)

Scan block window for the staking contract’s reward event:

Crystalvale → Reward CRYSTAL

Metis Influence → Influence reward token


Aggregate 24h reward emissions per PID:

rewards24hUSD = rewardAmount * tokenPriceUSD
emissionAPR = (rewards24hUSD / avgStakedLiquidityUSD) * 365 * 100

This yields true, real APRs based on actual emissions and real token prices.


---

6. Harvestable rewards (pending rewards)

For each PID and user:

Call pendingReward(pid, userAddress)

Convert to USD using the price graph.


This gives exact claimable CRYSTAL / Influence rewards.


---

✅ What I need from you

Please implement analytics ONLY for:

🔷 Crystalvale (DFK Chain – subnet)

🔶 DFK Metis Influence System

using the exact 24h backward-looking, log-based, on-chain approach described above.

Avoid limitations like:

“No 24hr fee APR”

“No emission APR”

“Static pool list”

“Pool names required”


Those are solved by log scanning + on-chain graph pricing + programmatic pool discovery.

Follow the methodology above exactly.


---

⚠️ Don’t use hardcoded pool names or centralized APIs

Everything should be:

RPC

Contract calls

Log scanning

Deterministic

On-chain only


Crystalvale uses DFK Subnet RPC
Metis Influence uses Metis Influence RPC (Metis Andromeda L2).


---

🎯 Summary You Should Follow

1. Discover pools using getPoolLength + getPoolInfo


2. Fetch LP token pair data using token0/token1/reserves/totalSupply


3. Build on-chain USD prices by propagating values through LP graph


4. Compute 24h fee APR via Swap logs


5. Compute 24h emission APR via RewardCollected logs


6. Compute TVL from reserves and token prices


7. Compute harvestable via pendingReward


8. Output everything for Crystalvale and Metis Influence

✔️ This is exactly how we were doing it.

You can now replicate it with confidence.
