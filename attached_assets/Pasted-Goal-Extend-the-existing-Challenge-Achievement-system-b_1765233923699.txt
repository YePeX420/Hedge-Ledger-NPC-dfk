Goal:
Extend the existing Challenge/Achievement system by adding 9 new challenges under the hero_progression category:

4 for Training Quests

5 for Crystal / Meditation usage

Use the same structure you already use for challenges and challenge_tiers (ChallengeDef style).
All new challenges must:

have categoryKey: "hero_progression"

show up under the Hero Progression section from /api/challenges

be seeded into the DB via the existing seed logic.

1. Add these Training Quest challenges

a) Trainer’s Path

MYTHIC: threshold 5 (isPrestige: true)

3. Implementation notes

Add these 9 challenge definitions into the same config/definition structure you already use (the source you seeded the original 36 challenges from).

Make sure their sortOrder places them under the Hero Progression section in a sensible group (e.g., all four training challenges together, then the five meditation challenges).

Re-run or update the seed so they populate challenges + challenge_tiers.

Confirm that GET /api/challenges returns them and that GET /api/challenges/progress/:userId can track progress for their metrics (even if current values are 0 until we wire metrics).

Do not remove or rename existing challenge keys; just append these.

When done, please summarize which file(s) you updated and confirm the 9 new challenge keys are visible in /api/challenges.
