📘 MASTER CHALLENGE SYSTEM DOCUMENT

PART 6 — CATEGORY 8: PLAYER-vs-PLAYER (PvP) CHALLENGES

(Late Game Competitive Loop → Skill Expression → Ranked Identity)

PvP is where players:

test their builds

test their heroes

optimize gear & pets

engage in the social meta

express mastery & creativity

create rivalries

climb seasonal ladders

earn prestige cosmetics

demonstrate true knowledge of DFK systems


This category sits AFTER summoning & hero development, because PvP:

requires optimized heroes

requires understanding class matchups

rewards deeper knowledge

is where progression becomes competitive


This is the final non-METIS competitiveness category in the document.
